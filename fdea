Idea for disk format:

Maybe each directory entry has a parent directory?
Could go for flat fs, with one central list of files/directories.
Maybe 256b blocks? Or 1k?
With 256 byte blocks, each file could contain no. of bytes in last entry in
a single byte in the directory entry.
OR no of blocks could be at the start, then the last block link would be the
no of bytes in final block. Then, an empty block would never start with zero!
Contain date modified? What format?
How many files in directory table? ~32 per 1024 block, if each is 32 bytes.
Ok, got it: block 0 is boot, block 1 is table of directory tables
16384 files max, seems ok
Or maybe larger block size - 2k per block? 65536 files? If 2 bytes are used
to reference a block, there would only be 65536 blocks...
Stick with 1k.
About boot: should there be a tag? Perhaps CIVT? CIVET123?
There should be a tag for whether a file is open - perhaps a counter for
read-only access, 1 byte, if 0xff then no more can be opened, then write access
just sets it straight to that. Then again, maybe that's more for file handlers,
shouldn't be on disk...
Also, block 1 should contain size of disk in bytes... maybe.
